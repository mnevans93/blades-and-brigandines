        <h3>Welcome to Blades and Brigandines. In this game, you will step into the sandals of a gladiator fighting their way to fame and glory within the storied Arena.
        As your foes fall before you, you will gain experience and grow ever stronger, and the spoils of your victories may be spent on new armor and weapons to enhance your combat prowess.
        Type in your gladiator's name below and Enter the Arena to begin, or click How to Play for an explanation of basic game mechanics.<br><br>
        Many come to the Arena, but few leave with their lives. What does your fate have in store for you?</h3>
